# 🔧 Liveblocks Setup Guide

## 🚀 **Quick Fix for Real-time Collaboration**

Your collaborative room is now working with Firebase-based real-time sync! To enable full Liveblocks integration for better real-time collaboration, follow these steps:

### **1. Get Liveblocks API Key**

```

### **3. Enable Liveblocks Integration**

Once you have the API key, uncomment the Liveblocks integration in `app/room/[roomId]/codepad.tsx`:

```typescript
// Uncomment these imports
